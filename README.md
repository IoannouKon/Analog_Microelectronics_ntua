# Analog_Microelectronics_ntua
The content is based on three courses Electronics 1,2,3 of the NTUA faculty of electrical and computer engineering. It is mainly based on the popular book sedra smith microelectronic circuits and contains both written, analytically solved exercises and simulations using the LTSPICE tool.
Also, the project was done using the MicroCap tool *similar to ltspice* and involves the construction of a receiver.
The exercises for Electronics 1 and 3, as well as for the project, are mostly correct. There might be some additional errors in the exercises for Electronics 2. I note that the exercises are fully solved and written in Greek.
